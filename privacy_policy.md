Privacy Policy for YouTube Music Rich Presence

Last Updated: 2025/06/01

Thank you for using YouTube Music Rich Presence ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your information.

1. Information We Collect

To provide its core functionality, the Extension accesses the following information when you are actively using YouTube Music (music.youtube.com):

Music Metadata: This includes the song title, artist name, and album name of the music you are currently playing on YouTube Music.
Extension Settings: If you configure any settings within the Extension (e.g., enabling or disabling the rich presence feature), these preferences are stored locally on your device using your browser's storage.
We do not collect any other personal information, such as your name, email address, browsing history (outside of the specific YouTube Music metadata), or any other sensitive data.

2. How We Use Information

The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:

To Provide Rich Presence: The primary purpose is to take the collected Music Metadata (song, artist, album) and transmit it to a local companion application that you install. This companion application then updates your status on supported platforms (like Discord) to show what you're listening to on YouTube Music.
To Store Your Preferences: Extension Settings are stored locally so the Extension remembers your choices across browsing sessions.
The Music Metadata is processed in real-time and is not stored by the Extension beyond its immediate use for updating your rich presence.

3. Information Sharing

Companion Application: The Music Metadata is shared with the local companion application that you must install for the Extension to function. This application is responsible for communicating with external platforms like Discord.
No Other Third Parties: We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your collected information to any other outside parties for marketing, advertising, or any other purposes.
4. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information handled by the Extension. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. The companion application you install has its own security considerations.

5. Children's Privacy

The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page or within the Extension's store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
